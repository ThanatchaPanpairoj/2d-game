##CONTRACT BETWEEN GAME ADMINSITRATORS AND PLAYERS:
By playing (clicking 'Start Game' or otherwise) JavaArcadeGame (henceforth referred to as 'the game') , THE PLAYER (who from hereon will be interchangeably referred to as 'you') enters into a binding contract that gives the game administrators (AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS) power to exercise complete dominion over the player. First and foremost, you (and any persons representing you directly or indirectly) will not hold any injury, illness, or death directly or indirectly related to the game liable to the game administrators. Any injury, illness, death, or misfortune directly or indirectly related to the game will be of no fault to the game administrators, and any attempt to sue or otherwise threaten the game administrators will be directed to the CONTRACT BETWEEN GAME ADMINISTRATORS AND PLAYERS (henceforth referred to as 'the contract'). Second, the game administrators reserve the right to change any rule, term, and/or condition in regards to the game at any time. You (and any persons associated with you) have no right whatsoever to protest against the game administrators in the settings (current and/or new). Playing the game amounts to acceptance of the contract, and any complaint filed against the game administrators will be addressed with the contract in mind.
